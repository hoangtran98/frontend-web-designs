# frontend-web-design-projects
 <p>These web designs are part of my online courseworks instructed by Jonas Schmedtmann, who is an online teacher on Udemy and have taught over 177,000 students.</p>

<p>It took me over a month to complete the front-page designs for two projects, Natours and Nexter. In return, I have learned so much about structuring HTML, using advanced CSS techniques, SASS and responsive web design. Feel free to download the projects for viewing </p>
